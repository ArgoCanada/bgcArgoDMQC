    "\n",
    "**Project Description** The goal of this project is to extend the capabilities of an existing Python package for delayed mode quality control of Argo float data. \n",
    "* It currently handles only oxygen, the goal is to handle at least one other biogeochemical variable, e.g., nitrate. (The full set also includes pH, chlorophyll, and backscatter.) \n",
    "* New functions and notebooks to demonstrate the new features need to be developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome** The expected outcome is an expanded Python package with the capability to perform delayed mode quality control on oxygen and at least one other biogeochemical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duties and Responsibilities** The intern will act as the primary software developer. This will include design, implementation, debugging, testing, and documenting of the code.\n",
